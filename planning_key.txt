NOTE: This is an English translation of enkät_nyckel.txt, which holds the original Swedish formulations of the planning survey questions.

NOTE: Some of the variables have minimal differences between years. Refer to "Documentation of The Planning Survey and Related Databases" by Elias Lindstenz (2025) for an appendix of the exact formulations used for each year of the planning survey.

NOTE: The questions are not identical to the ones in the planning survey. The questions documented here are generalised so that they apply to all years (i.e. "this year" instead of "1986").

All panel variables for the planning survey. Variables refer to each "firm" (firm or division).
Variables X1-X38 and X60-X65 are section I.
Variables X39-X57 are section II (production).
  Variables X41-X48 are about production capacity.
  Variables X49-X53 are about orders and prices.
  Variables X54-X57 are about inventories and purchases (input).

For questions with percents, the class midpoint is used.
Questions with three alternatives are answered, in order, -1, 0, or 1.
