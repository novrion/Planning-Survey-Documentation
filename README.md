# Documentation of The Planning Survey and Related Databases

This repository was created in the summer of 2025 at the Research Institute of Industrial Economics (IFN). It is a compilation of projects, surveys, and databases that are related to the Planning Survey, an annual survey of Swedish manufacturing industry that was conducted 1971-2001 by the Federation of Swedish Industries, and gradually taken over by IUI/IFN. The repository also holds a C++ library with tools to manipulate the Planning Survey database.

Read _Documentation of The Planning Survey and Related Databases_ (Lindstenz, 2025) for a complete documentation and technical specification. The document is attached to this repository as ```Documentation of The Planning Survey and Related Databases (2025).pdf```.
